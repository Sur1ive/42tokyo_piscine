## NOTE 
Because of 42 School norm requirements:
* One single variable declaration per line
* Declarations must be at the beginning of a function and declaration and an initialisation cannot be on the same line
* Each function cannot have more than 25 lines of code
* Each .c file cannot have more than 5 function-definitions
* C++ style code commenting is forbidden
* Project should be created just with allowed functions otherwise it's cheating
